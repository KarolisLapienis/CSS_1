1. git is a distributed version control system.
2. git clone command creates a complete copy of a remote repository on your local system.
3. We can clone a remote repository to local by using git clone command. Cloning is very important as it provides an independant, local copy of a project that allows faster access, offline work, serves as a backup and a secure space for development, version control, and experimentation before changes are synchronized with the central repository.
