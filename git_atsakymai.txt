1. git is a distributed version control system.
2. git clone command creates a complete copy of a remote repository on your local system.
3. We can clone a remote repository to local by using git clone command. Cloning is very important as it provides an independant, local copy of a project that allows faster access, offline work, serves as a backup and a secure space for development, version control, and experimentation before changes are synchronized with the central repository.
4. Initialization, branching, development, merging, hotfix when needed, cleanup.
5. git add command adds file changes or new files to the staging area.
6. git init command initializes a new git repository, creates a hidden .git directory that stores all git related data of this repository.
7. git push remote_repository_name_or_url_if_name_not_configured new_branch_name
you can use --set-upstream option to establish a tracking relationship between the local branch and the remote branch allowing you to use git push for that branch without specifying the name of repository and branch like so:
git push --set-upstream remote_repository_name_or_url_if_name_not_configured new_branch_name
git push and git pull after using --set-upstream won't require to specify depository url and branch.
8. git commit saves a new commit. It records all staged changes, metadata like author name, date and commit message, assigns a unique identifier and advances a branch to the new commit.
